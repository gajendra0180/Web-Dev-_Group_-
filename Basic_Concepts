to define comment in html 
<!-- way to write comment-->

1-> keep in mind , for inline element we cannot give width, height, and top margin and bottom margin but except in img tag
2. Note while using multiple classes with conflicting properties the class which is more at the bottom will dominate;
eg.
styles.css
 
.text-white {
    color: pink;
  }
  
.text-red {
    color: red;
  }
 
index.html
 <h1 class="text-white text-red">My Blog</h1>
 <h1 class=" text-red text-white">My Blog</h1>

Here In both the cases the .text-red will dominate due to its lower position in styles.css
