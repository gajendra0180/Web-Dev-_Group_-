For Terminal:
mkdir _FOLDERNAME_ ->Creates a folder with name _FOLDERNAME_
init -> initialises git 
ls -a ->shows hidden files 
ls -> show all files in a directory
cd _NAME_ -> move inside the director _NAME_
cd -> move up by one directory
touch _FILENAME_ -> makes a new file named _FILENAME_
nano _FILENAME_ -> opens file in terminal for editing purpose
cat _FILENAME_ -> shows all content of file
rm -rf _FILENAME_ ->deletes a file with name _FILENAME_
git log ->shows all log 
git status -> shows status of all files
git commit -m "This is a message" -> This Commits data with message shown by -m flag
Note: When some data is unstaged we can stage it using 'git add .' and now it's our will to commit it or not .. If we do not want to commit it and want to temporarily 
hold it somewhere like a backstage we can instead of 'commit' do 'git stash' This will send all the data to the backstage and the unstaged changes will be staged .
Now if we want to again bring them back from backstage to stage we can do 'git stash pop' and we will get all the data back and the pop stash changes become 
unstaged again.
