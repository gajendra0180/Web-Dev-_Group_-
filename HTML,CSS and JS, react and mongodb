1-> keep in mind , for inline element we cannot give width, height, and top margin and bottom margin but except in img tag
2-> Specificity

inline style attribute > id selector > class selector > element selector

Note while using multiple classes with conflicting properties the specificity class which is more at the bottom will dominate;
eg.
styles.css
 
.text-white {
    color: pink;
  }
  
.text-red {
    color: red;
  }
 
index.html
 <h1 class="text-white text-red">My Blog</h1>
 <h1 class=" text-red text-white">My Blog</h1>

Here In both the cases the .text-red will dominate due to its lower position in styles.css

3->
if we manually specify  width and height to inline elements then no effect will take place/
If we manually specify width and height to block level elements then their will be some effect,

In inline elements we cannot give margin to top and bottom only can be given in left and right direction;
Do not use padding in inline elements;




JS:
Typeof
Null -> object
Undefined -> undefined



Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.


substr -> (start,length)
substring -> (start,end)
slice -> (start,end)


In javascript:
All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

Formally said:

Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.



#Property Access
ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings:
Property access might be a little unpredictable:

It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)



# The two methods, indexOf() and search(), are equal?

They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?

The two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).




#In JS
String+number or number+string or string+string always yields concatenation
String(any other operator)number or number(any other operator)string or string(any other operator)string always yields mathematical evaluation

Note :
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "The result is: " + x + y;

output will be The result is: 1020   because (string+number+number) is taking place 



# But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
let y = new Number(123);
