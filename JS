Typeof
Null -> object
Undefined -> undefined

substr -> (start,length)
substring -> (start,end)
slice -> (start,end)


In javascript:
All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

Formally said:

Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.



#Property Access
ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings:
Property access might be a little unpredictable:

It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)



The two methods, indexOf() and search(), are equal?

They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?

The two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).
