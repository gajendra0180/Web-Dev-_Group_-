Typeof
Null -> object
Undefined -> undefined

substr -> (start,length)
substring -> (start,end)
slice -> (start,end)


In javascript:
All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

Formally said:

Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.



##Property Access
ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings:
Property access might be a little unpredictable:

It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)
